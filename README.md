# HR-ANALYTICS-POWER-BI-
This project aims to develop an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, leveraging Excel for initial data cleaning and manipulation. The goal is to provide actionable insights into HR metrics, such as employee performance, turnover rates, and departmental efficiencies.

Workflow and Tools
Data Preparation in Excel:

Data Collection: Gather HR-related data, including employee records, performance reviews, turnover rates, and other relevant metrics.
Data Cleaning: Use Excel to clean the data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates. Excel functions and features such as VLOOKUP, TEXT TO COLUMNS, and conditional formatting are employed to streamline the data preparation process.
Data Manipulation: Create pivot tables, perform calculations, and aggregate data as needed. This step ensures that the dataset is well-structured and ready for import into Power BI.
Data Import and Modeling in Power BI:

Data Import: Load the cleaned and manipulated data from Excel into Power BI. Utilize Power BIâ€™s data import features to integrate the Excel data seamlessly.
Data Modeling: Establish relationships between different data tables, create calculated columns and measures, and configure data models to facilitate effective analysis.
Visualization and Insight Generation:

Dashboard Creation: Design interactive and intuitive dashboards in Power BI. Incorporate visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables to represent HR metrics clearly.
Key Visualizations:
Employee Performance: Use bar charts and scatter plots to display performance ratings and identify high and low performers.
Turnover Analysis: Implement line graphs and pie charts to show turnover trends, reasons for leaving, and retention rates.
Departmental Insights: Create heat maps and treemaps to analyze departmental performance and resource allocation.
Interactivity: Add slicers and filters to allow users to drill down into specific data points, such as departments, job roles, or time periods.
Insights and Recommendations:

Trend Analysis: Highlight trends and patterns in employee performance and turnover rates, providing insights into potential areas for improvement.
Actionable Insights: Generate recommendations based on data trends, such as strategies to reduce turnover or enhance employee performance.
Reporting: Provide comprehensive reports and summaries for HR decision-makers, enabling data-driven decisions to improve organizational efficiency.
Conclusion
This project effectively combines Excel for data preparation with Power BI for advanced visualization and analysis, creating a powerful HR Analytics Dashboard. The dashboard delivers valuable insights into employee metrics, helping HR teams make informed decisions and enhance overall organizational performance. By utilizing both tools, the project ensures a thorough and efficient approach to HR analytics.
